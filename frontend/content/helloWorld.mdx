# Hello world from mdx!

## Regular markdown (GitHub flavor)

You can write anything here that is allowed in regulra markdown files as well.
This includes _italic_, **bold** and ~~struck-through~~ text, [links with a descriptor](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and even tables:

City | Country
--- | ---
Karlsruhe | Germany

Code blocks are supported as well - although it's quite unlikely we'll need them on such a website.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello world");
}
```

Other, essential features are
- lists, obviously
  - nested lists

As a surprise, mdx also supports task list items:
- [x] noticed it
- [ ] care about it

## Custom components

The following image is a regular React component.
By writing powerful, highly-adjustable components, we can write beautiful-looking articles with almost no effort in a maintainable way.

## A note on styling

As you can see, the normal design isn't very stunning.
We can provide custom styles using the `MDXProvider` component - but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
